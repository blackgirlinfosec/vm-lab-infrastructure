# vm-lab-infrastructure
A hands-on virtual lab showcasing my ability to design, deploy, and document networked environments with tools like Sysmon, Winlogbeat, and Wireshark for security analysis.

# ðŸ’½ Virtual Machine Setup Lab â€“ `vm-lab-infrastructure`

This is my first virtual lab environment using virtual machines to learn cybersecurity hands-on. Iâ€™ll be adding screenshots, diagrams, and tools like Sysmon and Wireshark as I go.

## ðŸ”§ Goals
- Learn to build virtual machines
- Set up a safe virtual network
- Install security tools for blue team practice

Stay tuned as I grow this project!
